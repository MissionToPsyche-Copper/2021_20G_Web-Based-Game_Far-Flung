  - It's time to plot our route to the Psyche! Click anywhere to continue.
  - We'll use Mars to give us a gravity assist and speed boost! Try using the angle
    slider to aim close to Mars.
  - Now, let's adjust the power so that we pass by Mars at just the right time! Try
    using the power slider.
  - Let's run the simulated flightpath to see if it reaches Psyche! Press the Launch
    button when ready.
  - '<Debug: If no win> Close one! We can use the Reset button to start the simulation
    over and try again.'
